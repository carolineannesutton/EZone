## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Avg_SL, echo=FALSE}

roughy2_sum <- summarySE(Roughy1, measurevar = "Length", groupvars = c("year","Ground","sex")) 

  
pd <- position_dodge(0.6) # move position horizontally b/c of overlap

Avg_SL <- ggplot(roughy2_sum, aes(x = year,y = Length, shape = Ground, colour = sex)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Length - ci, ymax= Length + ci),
                width =.7, position = pd) +
  geom_point( position = pd, size = 2)+
  geom_line(position = pd) +
  xlab("Year, Eastern Zone, July spawning population")+
  ylab("Average Standard Length (cm)")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(26,38,1),limits = c(26,38))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1986,2020), breaks = seq(1986,2020,2))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = c(.95, .05),
        legend.justification = c(1,0),
        legend.text =element_text(size=8),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 9, margin = margin(t=.05)),
        legend.spacing.y =unit(.05,'cm'))
plot(Avg_SL)
ggsave("Figures/AVg_SL.emf")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
